Bias is a common problem in today’s media, appearing frequently in text and in visual imagery. Users on social media
websites such as Twitter need better methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists –those who are motivated to
effect change related to some topic, need better methods
to identify and counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases in mind, in this paper we
propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that supports
identification of, and action on bias in visual news media.
In particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1)
identification of bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of
evidence to users; (3) enabling activists to inform the public
of bias and take action by engaging people in conversation
with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter
platform that explores the impressions that activists had of
our tool, and how people reacted and engaged with online
bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by discussing
design and implication of our findings for creating future
systems to identify and counteract the effects of news bias.
