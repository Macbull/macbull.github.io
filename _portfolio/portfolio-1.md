title: "Lake simulator (OpenGL, GLSL, Qt5, OpenCL, C++):"
excerpt: "Rendered a lake scene to showcase advance OpenGL concepts.
Instanced 3d models (with normal maps) of trees and rock were rendered over a tessellated hilly terrain with water. Multiple
render passes were used for effects like shadows, high dynamic range, reflection and refraction in water. Fireflies were simulated
using Boids (flocking) algorithm implemented in OpenCL. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

Rendered a lake scene to showcase advance OpenGL concepts.
Instanced 3d models (with normal maps) of trees and rock were rendered over a tessellated hilly terrain with water. Multiple
render passes were used for effects like shadows, high dynamic range, reflection and refraction in water. Fireflies were simulated
