Developed a 3D sketching interface and Mars simulator using OpenGL. The sketching allowed annotation of terrain as safe/unsafe in first
person view. These annotations were used for training online machine learning algorithm to automatically segment terrain and
plan a safe path while maximizing reward collection.
